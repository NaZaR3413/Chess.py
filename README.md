# Chess.py
Here is a text file containing the prolog code for my chess program. 

This program was built to run using GNU Prolog, simply upload the program and type "main." in order to run everything. 
The program is currently set to have an AI for both white and black pieces have a match. 

I am not responsible for any use of this program.
